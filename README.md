# LabVIEW for Containers 
Welcome to the official release of our containerized LabVIEW environment!
This project enables you to run LabVIEW seamlessly on Windows and Linux containers using Docker, making it easier to integrate with CI/CD workflows, automate testing, and ensure consistent build environments.

## Overview
We now officially support Windows and Linux containers to streamline CI/CD workflows. The base images are publicly available on Docker Hub under the official National Instruments account.

**Docker Hub repository:** [nationalinstruments/labview](https://hub.docker.com/r/nationalinstruments/labview)

This README provides step-by-step guidance on:
1. Accessing the image from Docker Hub
2. Running and deploying the container
3. Using the images in CI/CD pipelines
4. Building your own custom LabVIEW image using the provided Dockerfiles.

## Prerequisites 
1. Docker Engine or Docker CLI (version 20.10+)
2. At least 8 GB RAM (16 GB for Windows containers) and 4 CPU cores available (recommended)
3. Internet connection for downloading and/or building your own image.
4. Familiarity with Docker commands and concepts is helpful, especially if you plan to use or extend the Dockerfile.

## Modes of Delivery
We offer two delivery options depending on your use case:
1. **Prebuilt Images (Recommended for Most Users)**
    - Prebuilt images are available on Docker Hub and include a ready-to-use LabVIEW installation.
    - **Image name (repository:tag):** `nationalinstruments/labview:<release>-<platform>`
    - See [Releases](https://github.com/ni/labview-for-containers/releases) to get details on LabVIEW Versions with their supported Docker Containers and list of available images.
    - Use these images if you want a plug-and-play experience with minimal configuration.
2. **Official Dockerfile (For Advanced Users)**
    - For teams that require more control (e.g., adding custom tools, scripts, custom network settings), we provide an official Dockerfile to build your own image.
    - Use this approach if you want to:
        - Integrate your own automation or test scripts
        - Install specific dependencies
        - Debug or modify the container setup

## Using the Prebuilt Image (Recommended for Most Users)
Please see the [Using Prebuilt Images](./docs/use-prebuilt-image.md) guide for full details.
The documentation contains information about:
1. Image Specifications
2. Access the Docker Image
3. Run the Image
4. Example Usages

**Beta releases:** We publish beta versions of prebuilt Docker images for every new LabVIEW release. Look out for images with tag `<release>-<platform>-beta` on our official Docker Hub repo [nationalinstruments/labview](https://hub.docker.com/r/nationalinstruments/labview).

## How to build your own Image (For Advanced Users)
Please see the [Build your Own Image](./docs/build-your-own-image.md) guide for full details.
The documentation contains information about:
1. Prerequisites
2. Important Dependencies
3. Dockerfile Overview
4. Building the Image

## Example Usages
The [Examples guide](./docs/examples.md) contains information on example use cases of LabVIEW container images. 

## Releases & Changelog

Official LabVIEW container images are released on Docker Hub and documented
using GitHub Releases.

**Release notes:** https://github.com/ni/labview-for-containers/releases

Each GitHub Release corresponds to **one Docker image tag** published on Docker Hub.

## License
If you have acquired a development license, you may deploy and use LabVIEW software within Docker containers, virtual machines, or similar containerized environments (“Container Instances”) solely for continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD), automated testing, automated validation, automated review, automated build processes, static code analysis, unit testing, executable generation, and report generation activities. You may create unlimited Container Instances and run unlimited concurrent Container Instances for these authorized automation purposes. It is hereby clarified that You may only host, distribute, and make available Container Instances containing LabVIEW software internally within your organization where such Container Instances are not made available to anyone outside your organization unless otherwise agreed under your license terms. Container Instances may be accessed by multiple users within your organization for the automation purposes specified in this paragraph, without requiring individual licenses for each user accessing the Container Instance. In no event may you use LabVIEW software within Container Instances for development purposes, including but not limited to creating, editing, or modifying LabVIEW code, with the exception of debugging automation processes as specifically permitted above. You may not distribute Container Instances containing LabVIEW software to third parties outside your organization without NI’s prior written consent.
